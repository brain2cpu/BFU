- timestamped backup to be saved only if differs from the previous one (in case of any other failes)
- create a backup-task list (one such task for every file and every location), and keep track of operations in this
   way (if done first the fix above is not needed anymore)
- the error must specify location details
- add option to execute delete operations as well
- add a more detailed error log

- create WPF project
